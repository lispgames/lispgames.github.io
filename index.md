### Future home of lispgames.org?

[copy of old wiki](https://github.com/lispgames/lispgames.github.io/wiki/Main-Page) (don't bother editing much for now, may get overwritten if import needs fixed)

note that editing the wiki will add your ["primary github email"](https://github.com/settings/emails) to the git history for the wiki, so set it to private if that is a problem.

If you want your edits from the old wiki linked to your github account, either 
* tell |3b| on irc which email address to use (and which lispgames.org username if it isn't obvious)
* edit [this temporary page on wiki](https://github.com/lispgames/lispgames.github.io/wiki/old-users) and mention your old username (so i can get an email addr from the history)
* or set your primary email to private at [https://github.com/settings/emails]() if you don't want any real email address used
    (and then optionally do one of the above, though might not need to, since I tried to map them to the 'private' email where i knew a mapping from lispgames.org userid to github userid)
